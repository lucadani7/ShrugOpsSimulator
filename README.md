# ShrugOps: The Ultimate Deployment Simulator

**ShrugOps** is a retro-styled, high-stakes deployment simulator built with Next.js. It captures the chaotic essence of "pushing to production" where the odds are 50/50 and the excuses are 100% relatable. It is a satirical play on the popular **DevOps** culture. The name is a fusion of the "Shrug" emoticon and "Operations."

It is directly inspired by the legendary **"It works on my machine"** meme. In the world of software development, this phrase is the ultimate "get out of jail free" card used by developers when their code works locally but causes a total meltdown in the production environment. 

The core philosophy of ShrugOps is simple: 
> *If the deployment fails, just shrug, blame the environment, and move on.* ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## ⚠ Disclaimer
> This simulator is for entertainment purposes only. ShrugOps is not responsible for any actual production outages caused by excessive shrugging.
